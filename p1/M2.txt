1) Our flocking system performs well for a limited number of objects. For our
game ideas, it is likly good enough.

2) As the size of the flock increases, our flocking system's performance
degrades.

3) Our program starts to slow down with a flock size around 150 boids.

4) The bottleneck in our system is updating the direction of the boids. Each
boid compares its position with every other boid so it is quadratic in the
number of boids. We figured this out by playing around with our system and
knowing the behavior of the code.

5) To use larger flocks we could use one of the spatial data structures
discussed in class. Doing so will decrease the number of other boids each boid
needs to compare its position to.
